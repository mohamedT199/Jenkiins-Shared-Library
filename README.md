# Jenkiins-Shared-Library
Jenkins Shared Library for CI/CD
why code logic duplication for same logic in Building and Deploying artifacts ..?
so if team members gonna start new project they can reuse this groovy function and call it in Jenkins file for automate process of Building and Deploying artifacts 
and this is called Jenkins Shared Library.
